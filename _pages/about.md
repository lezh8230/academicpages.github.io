Variations of the tropical atmosphere-ocean coupled system plays a vital role in global climate variability, due to its high surface temperature and associated substantial precipitation. As a climate scientist, my research focuses on large-scale ocean-atmosphere dynamics and its role in the responses of tropical coupled climate system to the anthropogenic global warming and in the tropical climate variability. My research involves analyses of the observational datasets and climate model simulations, and performing numerical experiments using atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM), ocean GCM (OGCM) and fully coupled climate models.

Ningaloo Niño and its interaction with the tropical Pacific
------
An on-going research project targets understanding the marine heatwave events off the west coast of Australia (dubbed “Ningaloo Niño”), which has vital influences on Australian climate and marine biological activity. By conducting a hierarchy of OGCM experiments that isolate the effects of different physical processes, we find that the reduced transport of cold and dry air from the Southern Ocean to the southeast Indian Ocean (SEIO), and a positive cloud-radiation feedback make significant contributions to the positive SST anomalies (SSTA) of Ningaloo Niño [Zhang et al. 2018a]. Further, we have found an important role of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) in triggering the Ningaloo Niño. These findings provide new physical mechanisms for the formation and development of the Ningaloo Niño, which may help to improve the prediction of the catastrophic marine heatwave events in the SEIO.

Recently, we proposed a new coupling mechanism between the SEIO and the tropical Pacific based on observational analysis and numerical experiments. We find that the SEIO warm anomalies associated with the Ningaloo Niño can also drive enhanced Pacific trade winds, which subsequently cause cold SSTA in the central equatorial Pacific region. In turn, cold SSTA in the central tropical Pacific can also cause/enhance SEIO warming anomalies through both atmospheric bridge and oceanic connection. As such, we proposed a new inter-basin coupling mechanism that can enhance SSTA in the SEIO and central tropical Pacific [Zhang and Han 2018](https://lezh8230.github.io/atoc//publication/paper1). This result suggests an active role of the Ningaloo Niño in modulating the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In my future research, I will continue focusing on this research topic (see next section), as it is important for reducing uncertainty in climate predictions, not only for the tropical Indo-Pacific region, but also for remote regions such as the U.S..

Formation of El-Niño like SST warming
------
Global warming affects climate and weather worldwide, and some of these changes are closely associated with variations of the tropical Pacific conditions. How the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and the Walker circulation respond to anthropogenic global warming is therefore of great societal and scientific interests. During my graduate studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and my postdoctoral research at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), I focused on understanding changes of the coupled climate system in the tropical Pacific under global warming.

It is a commonly held view that climate models tend to simulate a weakened Pacific zonal SST gradient/Walker circulation in response to the greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. To understand these changes, we proposed a “longwave radiative-evaporative damping” mechanism that attributes the formation of the SST warming pattern to the present-day SST, wind and cloud distribution, adding confidence of the projection of future SST pattern derived by climate models [Zhang and Li 2014]. Through conducting idealized AGCM experiments, we also investigated physical mechanisms for the weakening of the Walker circulation under global warming, and we found that on top of the weakened zonal SST gradient, (i) the enhanced land-ocean thermal contrast in a warmer climate and (ii) the enhanced western North Pacific monsoon circulation both contribute to the weakening the Walker circulation [Zhang and Li 2016a; Zhang and Li 2016b]. These mechanisms combine to provide physical explanations for the weakening of Pacific trade winds and zonal SST gradient in climate model projections.
